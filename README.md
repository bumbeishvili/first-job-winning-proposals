> Organizational Chart using d3.js

I need someone to help me develop an organizational chart in d3.js.

I need something like https://jsfiddle.net/augburto/YMa2y/. The nodes will additionally display a profile pic along with the employee designation and optional department. Upon hover on each node, the employee profile card (simple div with user details needs to be displayed).

The tree will start from top of the tree.

One additional feature in the chart is to provide the users to locate themselves on the tree. It can be like, a button can be provided to the logged in user. Upon clicking that button the tree can animate to user node with only that node expanded while other nodes are collapsed.

The user should be able to zoom in/out and drag the chart as in the example jsfiddle.

If the tasks goes well, I am planning to expand the project and add some additional features (will be paid separately).

Please feel free to ask if you have any doubts in the requirements.

###  Winning Proposal

Hi, I have seen your job and I liked it. So , I tried to implement your requests and modified your jsfiddle chart

1. I allowed user to zoom out
2. I have added image on square
3. I also have implemented to show logged user in a tree
4. I have added tooltip

Here is result

https://cdpn.io/bumbeishvili/debug/PzdOJP/dGMXWKgzLVvk

Off course it's ugly yet, but it will be more beautiful after I will work on it.

I have a D3 graph of lines spoken by characters in a play (see attached screenshot) and I need a few updates to it. There are three issues related to viewing it on an iPad:



This is used on an iPad so the width of the graph should dynamically update when the device is rotated.


It takes two taps on a dot to see the tooltip, but it should only take one tap. Also, when tapping those dots that are close to the left edge, the tooltip goes off the left edge.


When tapping & dragging on the bottom graph, a magnifying glass should appear while dragging.


It uses the latest version of D3 (5.0rc4).

> Integrate BriteVerify Email Verification Into Web App Form

This is a pretty straight-forward task.

I have a php web app that has a form associated with it. Here's the form:

https://earlyestimator.com/client/load/b6d767d2f8ed5d21a44b0e5886680cb9

It does standard validation checking via js to ensure that an email address is entered for the Student Email field. But I need to validate that the user enters a *real* email address.

So I need you to integrate with my BriteVerify account via their API to do this form email verification & display a "Please enter a valid email address" error message if the user enters an invalid one.

Ideally, you will have worked with BriteVerify before.

Please let me know you read the task by telling me, "I'm real & read this whole task description."

If accomplished quickly & efficiently, there's a possibility for additional work

###  Winning Proposal

I'm real & read this whole task description.

I HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS PROJECT FOR YOU.

I am new on odesk,so it is hard for me to get first job,therefore I have written your project before you hire me and you can see and test it right now on this link: http://villaikalto.ge/brite/index.php

This example is done with my BriteVerify account key.

I have tested and this script works 100% but anyway if you find any problem I can solve it very soon.

In spite I believe my price is minimal,if someone suggests to work with less money I can decrease price for you.

In case you hire me I will integrate this script for your form in very short time.Also any changes you ask appriciated.

Regards,
Nika less

###  Winning Proposal

Hello,

I am a senior web developer with more than 6 years of experience in the field.

I have experience in many different frameworks and technologies but to focus on your requirements I have researched your website.

Looks like you are using Wordpress on danky.co.uk and these are small list of Wordpress projects I finished recently:

http://kimono.adjara.com/
https://www.clothtome.com/
https://rehabreviews.com/

I also have experience in using third party JSON APIs like CV library's job search API using different approaches including frontend technologies and fetching data with native Javascript or using different libraries like jQuery. Or fetching data on server side using PHP inside Wordpress theme or plugin.

As I mentioned, I have 6+ years experience in web development, but I'm new to Upwork and I'm really excited to win my first project and do my best to make you my first happy client on this platform.

Look forward to hear from you.

Best, Otar

### Job Posting 

Hello Guys,

I would like to Trigger a Facebook Pixel When someone clicks a button inside messenger so that I can create a custom conversions based on that and run conversion objective campaign Facebook ads.

Our messenger chatbot is built from manychat but if there is another way that you would to get this job done then we are happy to switch.

We build a chatbot inside manychat and right now when we trigger a pixel using thirdparty software like pixelme.com and uselinkme.com and botblocks.com they open a webview which basically fires a pixel. The problem is that's not a good user experience and we want to make that conversation seemless by firing that webview in the backend and still be able to create custom conversions.

Another problem with opening a webview on desktop is it opens a whole new tab which is also not good for user experience.

I want to be able to fire a pixel and continue to next message like as if nothing happened but pixel is fired on the background.

Message > Button Clicked > Fire Pixel > Another Message


If you think you can do this and fire a pixel without opening a webview and still be able ti create custom conversions then apply for this project. And we will discuss the cost of making this happen.

Thanks

###  Winning Proposal

Hi,

I got interested in your job. It can be done with Iframe, after clicking the button, it will send the information to this webpage where you wanted button clickers to go, this will have pixel code and fires the click, iframe will be no display so the clients won’t see anything.

I have done something like it for my landing pages with Iframe.

Thanks,

Mariam
